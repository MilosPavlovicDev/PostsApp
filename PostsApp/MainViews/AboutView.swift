Thank you, SMG, for this opportunity to show you what I can build in a short time frame. This was a homework assessment and the third part of the recruitment process. I hope I covered everything in this project that was requested by the company.

I added some of my personal touch so this project actually feels like a real app.

Itâ€™s very hard finishing an app like this because I see the potential and just want to keep adding new features, but I think this is just enough. So I hope you like it and that this app gets me one step closer to a position at the company!
