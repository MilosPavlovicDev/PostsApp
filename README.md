Hello,
First coding session:
- Date : 3.6.2025
- StartTime : around 18:15
- EndTime : around 21:15

Second coding session:
- Date : 4.6.2025
- StartTime : around 14:15
- had pauses for lunch and other in between, around 2 hr
- EndTime : around 21:30

So the project is finished, i commited the last part of the app. 
I talked about my feelings about the app that i wish i could have done more stuff and add more features, and other arhitecture like proper error handling, add some user like features(fav posts, commenting, name saving)... 
But because this is a homework assessment i dont want to overcomplicate it and i needed to stop somewhere.
This was a fun small project for me, its always a good feeling when you open XCode and start a new project, i think this goes for most developers, but hits different for iOS development.
Enough chit-chat lets talk about the app.
So first thing i did was open figma and built a design for the app witch i would follow while coding.
Here it is
