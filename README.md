Hello,

First coding session:
- Date : 3.6.2025
- StartTime : around 18:15
- EndTime : around 21:15

Second coding session:
- Date : 4.6.2025
- StartTime : around 14:15
- had pauses for lunch and other in between, around 2 hr
- EndTime : around 21:30

So the project is finished, i commited the last part of the app. 

I wish i could have done more stuff and add more features, and other arhitecture like proper error handling, add some user like features(fav posts, commenting, name saving)... 

But because this is a homework assessment i dont want to overcomplicate it and i needed to stop somewhere.

This was a fun small project for me, its always a good feeling when you open XCode and start a new project, i think this goes for most developers, but hits different for iOS development.

Enough chit-chat lets talk about the app.

The app was built here:

![Setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5129d5cb-3a93-4e07-a8af-c376a32e88bf)


So first thing i did was open figma and built a design for the app witch i would follow while coding.

Here it is:

After i was happy with the design it was to late in the day to start coding so i left it for tomorrow.

Two coding sessions after here is the app preview in AppStore like design:

And here is a visual demonstration of the app:

The app is optimized to work in dark mode as well!

Minimum deployment iOS version is: 18.0 

The app is built for iPhone only and only for Portrait orientation!

Tested on simulator iPhone 16 Pro 18.5 and iPhone 13 18.5

Built on Macbook M2 air 256gb (I would coded faster if this was a pro ðŸ¥²)

As you can see from the project i added delays for network calls to display the Placeholders with Skeleton animation.

As for the features: Skeleton/Shimmer animation, Lottie SDK success animation for post publishing, animated button inside CreatePostView, Dismiss keyboard on screen press inside CreatePostView, Added image previews on the PostsView for a nicer UI, Created custom avatar icons for the comments for a nicer Ui, Designed Placeholders for the Comments and Posts, Added network check with a overlay if lost connection, Added a custom color for the Smg branding so the app is fully branded, About page and other...

Thats all from me.

Best regards to the Smg team.

Hope you like this!
